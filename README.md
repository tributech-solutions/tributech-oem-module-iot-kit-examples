# tributech-oem-module-iot-kit-examples
This Git repository holds samples and documentations for the OEM module IoT kit.
Each of the folders on root level is themed and keyed to a specific development board which will act as the base for the sample kit.
The first sample kit uses the nRF52840-DK as a baseboard so this will also be used as an example for the structure:

- nRF52840-DK
    - README.md

        This file contains the overall documentation and setup for the sample kit. It holds information such as prerequisites, setup of the sample kit, data consumption and more.

    - images

        The images folder contains the images used in the README documentation.
        
    - Other folders will each hold a sample application for the afore mentioned base board in this case the nRF52840-DK.

In the near future the sample library will be updated with additional  base boards and samples.
